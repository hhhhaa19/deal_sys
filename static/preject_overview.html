    <h2>Project Architecture Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Frontend:</strong> The interface uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to manage dynamic content and asynchronous requests.</p>
    <p><strong>Backend:</strong> Development is based on Python's Flask framework, which supports simplified backend structure and rapid development.</p>
    <p><strong>Project Structuring:</strong> The project experienced redundancy issues with multiple teams fetching the same BTC data from three different sources, leading to a lack of clear structure and layering. This has impacted code maintainability and readability, suggesting a need for a detailed initial task assignment and a microservices approach for clearer service boundaries and easier future expansions.</p>
    <p><strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Flask's built-in thread pool elegantly handles thread safety. Transactions operate in separate threads created via <code>threading.Thread</code> to avoid blocking the thread pool, with <code>threading.Event</code> objects managing start and stop signals for trading operations. A global variable <code>trading_pair</code> is protected by a <code>trading_pair_lock</code> to ensure thread-safe operations.</p>
    <p><strong>Database Management:</strong> The database handling is secure against SQL injections by validating queries server-side. However, the lack of a connection pool results in high overhead from frequent open/close connections. Introducing a database connection pool and handling potential concurrency issues like dirty reads or phantom reads could improve performance and reliability.</p>
    <p><strong>Automation and Service Availability:</strong> Service availability is robust due to unified exception handling and well-maintained logs, which simplify maintenance and debugging. Future enhancements could include SMS notifications to further automate and improve service responsiveness.</p>
